# @openclaw/typex

TypeX channel plugin for OpenClaw.

## Install (local checkout if you've downloaded the source)

```bash
openclaw plugins install path/to/openclaw-extension-typex
```

## Install (npm)

```bash
openclaw plugins install openclaw-extension-typex
```

Onboarding: select TypeX and confirm the install prompt to fetch the plugin automatically.

Once the actual TypeX provider is implemented in the core `openclaw` repo, you can extend
this plugin to wire outbound messaging and gateway/runtime logic.
